## Overview

CloudQ is a job management system that targets on executing AI/HPC tasks on on-premise systems, cloud and supercomputers with a unified interface.
It has the following features.

- Input, output and status of jobs are stored on an Amazon S3 compatible object storage.
- User can write a jobscript in two formats; **local jobscript** and **meta jobscript**.
  A job described in meta jobscript can run on any systems managed under CloudQ.
  A job described in local jobscript runs only on a specific system, but the job can use all functions the system provides.
- The installation and administration of CloudQ do not require administrator privileges.

CloudQ consists of two components.

One is **Agent** which submits jobs and manages them on a system.
If you have accounts on multiple clouds or supercomputers, you can submit jobs to them using CloudQ by installing Agents on them.

Currently, CloudQ Agent supports the following systems.

- [ABCI](https://abci.ai/)
- [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/)

The second CloudQ component is **Client**.
By using Client on a user's terminal, user can submit and manage jobs on CloudQ.

![CloudQ Architecture](/docs/fig_cloudq_arch.png)

CloudQ provides an additional component named **Builder**.
Builder helps setting up compute clusters on clouds.

Currently, CloudQ Builder for AWS is available.
CloudQ Builder for AWS creates clusters using Slurm as their job scheduler.
It installs CloudQ Agent on cluster's head node.

## Installation

[Installation Guide](/docs/INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md) describes how to install and configure CloudQ.

The following documents describe how to setup CloudQ environment in a specific scenario.

1. [Use ABCI](/docs/EXAMPLE_ABCI.md)
   - Use ABCI as the compute resource and ABCI Cloud Storage as the job storage.

2. [Use AWS](/docs/EXAMPLE_AWS.md)
   - Use AWS as the compute resource and the job storage.

3. Use ABCI and AWS (coming soon)
   - Use ABCI and AWS as the compute resources and ABCI Cloud Storage as the job storage.


## Usage

### Agent

In an environment where CloudQ Agent does not run automatically, you need to launch CloudQ Agent as follows.

```console
$ cloudqd --daemon
```

On compute clusters built by Builder for AWS, CloudQ Agent automatically starts.

### Client

#### Submit a Job

The following example submits a job described in local jobscript.

```console
$ cloudqcli submit --script cloudq/example/ljob_tf_mnist.abci.sh \
                   --submit_to YOUR_SYSTEM --submit_opt 'SUBMIT_OPTION'
Job (3f7e7681) ljob_tf_mnist.abci.sh has been submitted.
```

The following example submits a job described in meta jobscript.

```console
$ cloudqcli submit --script cloudq/example/mjob_tf_mnist.sh
Job (e210c27c) mjob_tf_mnist.sh has been submitted.
```

#### Submit a Dependent Job

The following example submits a job that depends on other jobs.

```console
$ cloudqcli submit --script cloudq/example/ljob_tf_mnist.abci.sh \
                   --submit_to YOUR_SYSTEM --submit_opt 'SUBMIT_OPTION' \
                   --hold_jid '3f7e7681,e210c27c'
Job (fc2d6f45) ljob_tf_mnist.abci.sh has been submitted.
```

#### Submit an Array Job

The following example submits an array job.

```console
$ cloudqcli submit --script cloudq/example/mjob_array.sh --array_tid 1-4:1
Job (a38c9a9f) mjob_array.sh has been submitted.
```

In the meta jobscript, the environment variables can be used to refer to task ID and other information.
See [Environment variables](#environment-variables)

### Builder for AWS

CloudQ Builder for AWS is provided as `cloudqaws` command.
It uses AWS default profile to build a cluster.
Be aware that the AWS default profile is properly set.

#### Create a Cluster

`cloudqaws create` creates a cluster on AWS.
Before creating a cluster, you need to set up an SSH key pairs to log in to the cluster head node.

```console
$ cloudqaws create --name your-cluster-name \
                   --keypair YOUR-KEYPAIR-NAME \
                   --cs_profile abci --cs_endpoint https://s3.abci.ai \
                   --cs_bucket cloudq
The stack (your-cluster-name-vpc) is creating. Please wait a minute.
The stack (your-cluster-name-nodes) is creating. Please wait a minute.
AWS compute cluster (your-cluster-name) has been created.
```

#### List Clusters

`cloudqaws list` shows you status of compute clusters you requested to create.

```console
$ cloudqaws list
Cluster Name     Status     Creation Time
---------------------------------------------------
your-cluster-01  COMPLETED  2022/01/23 11:22:33 UTC
your-cluster-02  COMPLETED  2022/02/01 23:59:59 UTC
your-cluster-03  CREATING
your-cluster-04  FAILED
```

#### Delete a Cluster

```console
$ cloudqaws delete --name your-cluster-name
The stack (your-cluster-name-nodes) is deleting. Please wait a minute.
The stack (your-cluster-name-vpc) is deleting. Please wait a minute.
AWS compute cluster (your-cluster-name) has been deleted.
```

### Change log level of CloudQ

Commands CloudQ Client„ÄÅAgent and Builder can change the log level by the respective `config.ini` setting or `--log_level` option.
Log levels can be specified from `INFO` or `DEBUG`.
The value specified with the `--log_level` option takes precedence.
If neither is specified, `INFO` is applied as the default log level.
